NodeJS
------
    - NodeJS is the server side scripting language.
    - NodeJS used to develop the servers.
            Http server
            TCP server
    - we will develop Node Applications by using JavaScript.
    - we will start Node Server by using either "node" or "nodemon".
    - "node" or "nodemon" are the tools provided by NodeJS.
    - "nodemon" tool used to start the node server in watch mode (live mode).
    - we will install "nodemon" tool by using following command.
            > npm install -g nodemon@latest

            - "npm" stands for node packaging manager.
            - "npm" is the integrated tool of node js.
            - "-g" stands for global installation.
    - node supports modules

    - predefined libraries called as modules.

modules in NodeJS
-----------------
1) mysql
    - this module used to connect to mysql database.

2) mongodb
    - this module used to connect to mongodb database.
    - the stable version of mongodb module is 2.2.32.

3) mssql
    - mssql module used to connect to SQLServer.

4) express
    - express module used to develop the rest apis (webservices).

5) body-parser
    - this module used to read the post parameters sent by client
      applications(Angular,ReactJS).

6) cors
    - this module used to enable the communication between different
      ports.

7) jwt-simple
    - jwt stands for json web token.
    - jwt-simple module used to generate the tokens.
    - in general we will use these tokens for authentication purpose.
    - this authentication system technically called as "token based
      authentication system"


8) multer
    - this module used to upload the images to the server.


9) socket.io
    - this module used to develop the chat applications.



- we will download above modules by using either "npm" or "yarn"

- "npm" and  "yarn" both are automation tool used to download the node modules.

- "yarn" is the advanced tool provided by facebook, used to download
  the modules in faster manner.

- we will install "yarn" tool by using following command.

    > npm install -g yarn@latest

- node modules downloads to "node_modules" folder in current path.

- in general we will test rest api calls by using "Postman".

- "Postman" is the software used to test the rest api calls.

Ex_1:
    develop the rest apis by using Node Server.


Step 1:
    create the directory   (folder)

    Ex.
            RestAPI

Step 2.
    download express module

    > yarn add express --save


Step 3.
    develop the rest api's by using NodeJS

    Ex.
        server.js

Step 4.
    Start the server

    > nodemon server

Step 5.
    Test the following rest api's by using Postman

    => http://localhost:8080/   (GET)

    => http://localhost:8080/mongodb   (GET)

    => http://localhost:8080/    (POST)

    => http://localhost:8080/firebase   (POST)
