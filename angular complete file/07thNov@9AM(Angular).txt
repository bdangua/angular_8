7) src/favicon.ico

8) src/index.html

	- angular starts the execution from "index.html" file.

	- "index.html" file is the landing template.

	- "index.html" file is the main template in angular application.

	- main template internally invokes the "main.ts" file.

	- "main.ts" file internally invokes the "app.module.ts" file.

	- "app.module.ts" file containes our applications registrations.

	- based on registrations our applications will be executed
	  by angular framework.


9) src/main.ts


	- this file acting as interface between main template to
	  registration file.

	  (app.module.ts <==> index.html)


10) src/polyfills.ts

	- polyfills.ts file is the library.

	- this library helps to execute the projects into
	  different browsers.

	Ex.
		Chrome
		Mozilla
		IE
		---
		---
		---


11) src/styles.css

	- we will define global styles here.

	- what ever the styles we define here, automatically applicable
	  to entire angular application.



12) src/test.ts


	- this file representing sample testing file.


13) editorconfig & .gitignore

	- these two files not related to angular applications.

	- first file related to "VisualStudioCode" Configurations.

	- second file related "Git" configurations.


14) angular.json

	- this file representing directory structure of angular
	  application.

	- we can customize directory structure based on application
	  requirement by using angular.json file.

	- this file used to configure the 3rd party technologies

		=> jQuery
		=> BootStrap
		=> ReactJS
		=> VueJS

		    ---
		    ---
		    ---



15) browserslist

	- it will show supporting and non supporting browsers
	  based on Angular9 version.



16) karma.conf.js

	  "karma with jasmine" tool.

	- "karma.conf.js" file representing the configuration file
	  of karma tool


17) package.json

	- this file used to download the 3rd party libraries.

	- all these libraries downloads to "node_modules" folder.


18) tsconfig.app.json

	- this file acting as controlling file for entire angular
	  application.

	- what ever the business logic written here, automatically

	Ex.
	    removing the white spaces in entire angular applications

	    overcome the data redundancy in entire angular applications.


19) tsconfig.json

	- it contain TypeScript Configurations



20) tsconfig.spec.json

	- this file is the controlling file for all unit test cases
	  present in angular project.

		   	***** Components *****

	- Angular is the Framework.

	- Angular Framework follows the MVC Design Pattern.

		M - Model

		V - View

		C - Component

	- Simple TypeScript class behaves like Component.

	- We Can Create more than one component in angular applications.

	- Angular Applications are component based applications.

	- Because of Components Code Reusability is high in Angular
	  Compared to AngularJS.

	- Component acting as Interface Between View and Service
	  in MVC Architecture.

	- we can establish the communication between server to database
	  by using modules.

		Ex.
			mysql
			mssql
			mongodb
			firebase
			oradb
			mongoose
			---
			---
			---

	- we can provide communication between service to server
	  by using AJAX Calls (Observables).

	- we can establish communication between component to service
	  by using dependency injection.

	- the communication between view to component called as 
	  two way data binding.

firstApp
       src
	 app
	   first.component.ts
	   first.component.html


	   app.module.ts
	 index.html
*****************************************

	- "first.component.ts" file used to create the component.

	- "first.component.html" file used to display the component
	  output.

	- "first.component.html" also called as external template
	  of component.

	- in general we will register our applications (component)
	  in app.module.ts file.

	- index.html file is the main template.
