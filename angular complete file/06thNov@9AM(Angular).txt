Angular Environmental Setup
---------------------------

1) download and install NodeJS

	- "NodeJS" is the server side scripting language.

	- "NodeJS" used to develop the servers.

	- Angular Installation Depending on Node Server.


website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

file    : node-v12.13.0-x64.msi



2) download and install Git

	- "Git" is the open source repository maintained by
	  microsoft.

	- "Git" repository containes so many open source libraries
	  related to angular.


website : https://git-scm.com/download/win

file    : Git-2.24.0-64-bit.exe



3) install yarn tool. 

	- we will install yarn tool by Command Prompt.

	- yarn tool given by facebook.

	- yarn tool used to download the libraries.

	- we will install yarn tool by using following command.


> npm install -g yarn@latest

	- "npm" stands for node packaging manager.

	- "npm" is the inbuilt tool of node js.

	- "-g" stands for global installation.

	- current version of yarn tool is "1.19.1"



4) install angular

	- we will install angular by using command prompt.

> npm install -g @angular/cli@latest

	- "cli" stands for command line interface.

	- "cli" is the tool given by angular framework

	- "cli" tool used to build the angular applications.

	- current version of "cli" is "8.3.17"



5) link the "yarn" tool to "cli" tool

	- we will link "yarn" tool to "cli" tool by using following
	  command.


	> ng config -g cli.packageManager yarn

		- where "M" is capital


6) create the angular application

	> ng new firstApp

		- where "firstApp" is the name of angular application.



7) switch to angular application

	> cd firstApp

		- we can switch to angular application.


8) execute the angular application

	> ng s -o

		- automatically we can execute angular application.

		- "s" stands for serve

		- "-o" stands for open the default browser.

		- angular application deployed into "lite" server.

		- "lite" is the webserver given by microsoft.

		- "lite" server specially designed by microsoft to
	          execute angular applications.

		- by default "lite" server running on port no.4200


while creating the angular application it will ask the 
set of questions


1) would you like to add angular routing (y/n) ?  n

	please choose "n"


2) choose the style sheet

	> css

	by default css will select.


directory structure of angular application
------------------------------------------

1) e2e

	- e2e stands for end to end.

	- e2e directory used to write the end to end test cases to
	  angular applications.


	- in general testing divided into two types.

		1) Manual Testing

		2) Automation Testing

	- Manual Testing is Deprecated, now a days no project using
	  Manual Testing.

	- Automation Testing divided into 3 Types.

		1) Unit Testing

		2) Integration Testing

		3) End to End Testing

	- Testing particular functionality with assumptions called as
	  Unit Testing.

	- Testing particulat functionalities with exact environment
	  called as Integration Testing (Real Environment).

	- Testing Particular functionality with "end to end scenarios 
	  (production mode)" called as end to end testing.




2) node_modules

	- "node_modules" directory containes libraries.

	- those libraries helps to execute the angular application.


3) src/app

	- this directory used to deploy the angular applications.

	Ex.
		Components

		Directives

		Services

		Pipes

		Modules

		----
		----
		----


4) src/app/app.module.ts


	- this file we can call registration file.

	- this file also called as Module file.

	- this is the Default Module in Angular Application.

	- this file used to register the angular applications.

	- once if we register, then only angular applications will
	  be executed by angular framework



5) src/assets

	- this directory used to deploy the static resources

	Ex.
	   images
	   multimedia files
	   xml files
	   json files
	   ---
	   ---
	   ---


6) environments
	
	- in general we have 3 types of environments

		1) development environment

		2) production environment

		3) testing environment

	- what ever the required environment, we will configure
	  in environments directory.
