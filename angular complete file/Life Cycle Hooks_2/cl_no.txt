--------------------
    - when ever angular framework identifies the memory for component, then this life cycle hook will be executed.

-----------------------
    - if framework reserved the memory for component
      successfully, then this life cycle hook will be executed.

ngAfterViewInit()
-----------------
    - if component loaded successfully in memory then this life cycle hook will be executed.

    - mainly we are using this life cycle hook for datatype conversions.

    - if data populated successfully then this life cycle hook will be executed.

ngOnDestroy()
-------------
    - it is used to perform the cleanup operations before killing the component by framework.
