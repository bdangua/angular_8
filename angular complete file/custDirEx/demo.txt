Custom Directives
-----------------
    - Creating our own Directives based on application requirement called as Custom Directives.

    - we can create two types of Custom Directives.
    
    1) Attribute Type Custom Directives
    2) Structural Type Custom Directives

Attribute Type Custom Directives
--------------------------------
Ex.
    <div myDir></div>
        - where "myDir" is teh custom Directive.
        - "myDir" behaves like Attribute for "div".

    - "Directive" is the predefined class, used to assign the logical name to custom Directive.

    - "myDir" is the logical name to custom Directive.

    - "ElementRef" is the predefined class, used to manipulate the DOM.

    - where "div" behaves like "DOM Element".

    - "HostListener" is the predefined class, used to apply the mouse events.
